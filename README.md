# Beagles_vs_Bagles
All in all this is learngin/ fun project mostly for me
#Project definition
This project aims to use images from sites like GettyImages and so on to feed into a Machine Learning classifier to find out, whether or not the images contains a beagle or a bagle (cheesy word play I know :D).
It tries to help get confident in TDD and other methods as well as deepen my knowledge in Data Engineering and Machine Learning and is therefore not to taken seriously. You will find different comments here and there about code coverage etc. that aren't meant for others but mostly for me.
